# clothes-webshop!

This is my first SQL project!
In this project I built tables with SQL for products, customers, orders and products in orders (database diagram under). 

![Database_diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60434409/131126549-70950cd4-2d73-43d2-bba3-95b8c63c90a3.jpg)

I also joined tables for views of product sales and customer orders.

In the project files you can find sql and cvs files of these tables and views.
